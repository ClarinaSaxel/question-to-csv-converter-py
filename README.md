# question-to-csv-converter-py
greekdoctor has already provided a java script snippet to get questions from the website finalexam.hu in a text file [here](https://github.com/greekdoctor/finalexam-questioncollector-js/tree/main). I am now changing that format to a csv file so it can be used for [brainyoo flashcards](https://brainyoo.de/dokumentation/karteikarten-der-desktop-client-fuer-win-mac/108777-2/).

# usage
1. Save the python file in the the folder with all the textfiles
2. Open this folder in the editor of your choice (I used Microsoft's Visual Studio Code)
3. Run the python script, this will create a csv file for every textfile in the folder
4. Reruns will overwrite the previous csv files
